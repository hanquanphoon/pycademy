    "<p> One type of machine learning problem is the classfication problem. The goal of classification is that given data about something, assign it a discrete, qualitative label. A classic classification problem is what a spam filter does. A programmer has a list of emails, each with data about it such as the number of words in the email or the number of capital letters in the title, and whether or not that email is considered by him to be spam. Then he come up with a model that relates the probability of an email being spam to the data. It is called \"training the model\", and that list called the training data. Then if a new email comes in, the model will calculate the probability of it being spam. If the email has a higher probability of being spam than not spam, it will be labeled \"spam\" and be delivered to the spam folder, and vice versa. </p>\n",
    "<p> In practice, the training data often comes in a table, with each email (\"instance\") being a row and each parameter being a column. One of the columns will be the label you want to assign, which is called the target. A new email, whether or not it is spam is unknown, is also an instance, except with the target column blank. The problem is then to fill this column. Conversely, any problem that asks you to fill an empty column of a table for a certain instance with a discrete label is a classification problem. </p>\n",

    "<p> In our example, we will use the famous Iris flower dataset. The table contains the length and width of the sepal and petal of samples of flowers from the Iris genus collected in an area, as well as the species name of the flower, determined by a qualified biologist. Then imagine somebody goes to the same area, finds a flower and measures the length and width of its sepal and petal. But that person cannot tell the species of that flower. Then a classification problem is to determine, from the measurement data, what species the flower most likely is. </p>"
